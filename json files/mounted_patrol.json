  "hours": "Monday-Sunday, Varying Hours from 0800-2100",
  "mission": "To aid RUPD by conducting daily patrols in specific areas of Rutgers University. Community Service Officers will provide professional, courteous service with a uniformed physical presence and direct observation of all University facilities, Faculty, Staff, Students, and Guests. They will protect the interests of the university’s community. This will be accomplished by CSOs being alert, vigilant at all times, and by utilizing any and all training. CSOs will keep in mind their mission purpose which is: TO OBSERVE AND REPORT, render assistance when necessary, and to ensure all parties’ interests are protected. A unique aspect of Mounted Patrol is that the incorporation of horses allows for heightened public relations opportunities that should be taken whenever safe.",
